# Karnaugh-Map-Simplifier

##Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to simplify boolean expressions. It accomplishes the simplification using Quine-McClusky for expressions over 4 variables, and Karnaugh Map for expressions with 4 and less variables.

##Features proposed:
* Allow simplification of boolean expressions from truth-table
* Permit SOP or POS conversion (possible)
* Use Quine McCluskey method of simplification


##Currently in development:
* Implementation of Quine-McClusky to simplify expressions
* Representations of groupings in Karnaugh-Map
