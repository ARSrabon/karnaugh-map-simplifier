##Purpose
The purpose of this application is to simplify boolean expressions. It accomplishes the simplification using Quine-McClusky for expressions over 4 variables, and Karnaugh Map for expressions with 4 or less variables. Feel free to contribute! 

##Features proposed
* Allow simplification of boolean expressions from truth-table
* Permit SOP or POS conversion (possible)
* Use Quine McCluskey method of simplification, with branch-and-bound method
* Show pairing visualization for up to 4 variables
* Allow for mapping of pairings and SOP determination

##Completed
* Truth Table to SOP expressions
* Complete user interface with Swing
