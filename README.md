# Karnaugh-Map-Simplifier

##Purpose:
The purpose of this application is to simplify boolean expressions. It accomplishes the simplification using Quine-McClusky for expressions over 4 variables, and Karnaugh Map for expressions with 4 or less variables. There will also be the option to design your own patterns and this program will convert it to SOP! Feel free to contribute! 

##Features proposed:
* Allow simplification of boolean expressions from truth-table
* Permit SOP or POS conversion (possible)
* Use Quine McCluskey method of simplification

##Currently in development:
* Implementation of Quine-McClusky to simplify expressions
* Representations of groupings in Karnaugh-Map

##Completed:
* Truthtable to SOP expressions
* Complete user interface with Swing
